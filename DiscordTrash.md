### Discord ban fair community and don't ban scammer servers

The discord team is not able to protect the customer in any way (encryption etc..), they prefer to make money than to prevent all scammers from buying nitro. They know how to ask for a phone verification to remove a server but not to buy a nitro, among other things discord does nothing to prevent the evil and pretends to fight the "spam" while they fight with slingshot, it is not necessarily easy but necessary.

They ban my server, trusted shop with happy customer but don't ban people that scamming lot of money to skid when i sent big mail with lot of proofs
