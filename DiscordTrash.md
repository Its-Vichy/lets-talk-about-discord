### Discord ban fair community and don't ban scammer servers

The discord team is not able to protect the customer in any way (encryption etc..), they prefer to make money than to prevent all scammers from buying nitro. They know how to ask for a phone verification to remove a server but not to buy a nitro, among other things discord does nothing to prevent the evil and pretends to fight the "spam" while they fight with slingshot, it is not necessarily easy but necessary

# So why a part of the community moved on guilded ?

Siegfried and V4NSH4J are a good exemple:
