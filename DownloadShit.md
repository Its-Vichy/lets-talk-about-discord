Please stop to download shit tool (aka grabber) on youtube, when you download a script please read it, check the dependency and download from trusted people (like me <3)

Github has always been a healthy place to get all kinds of software and scripts created by our wonderful community of enthusiasts,
but there are still many children near puberty who have fun posting viruses (not_a_virus.exe).
In this case it is very easy to see the deception but I have made this grabber to prove that anyone with a minimum of brains can do a lot of damage !
